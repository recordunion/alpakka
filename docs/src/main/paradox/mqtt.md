# MQTT Connector

The MQTT connector provides an Akka Stream source, sink and flow to connect to MQTT servers.

## Usage

First we need to define various settings, that are required when connecting to an MQTT server.

Scala
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/scala/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/scaladsl/MqttSourceSpec.scala) { #create-connection-settings }

Java
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/java/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/javadsl/MqttSourceTest.java) { #create-connection-settings }

Here we used @scaladoc[MqttConnectionSettings](akka.stream.alpakka.mqtt.MqttConnectionSettings$) factory to set the address of the server, client ID, which needs to be unique for every client, and client persistence implementation (@extref[MemoryPersistence](paho-api:org/eclipse/paho/client/mqttv3/persist/MemoryPersistence)) which allows to control reliability guarantees.

Then let's create a source that is going to connect to the MQTT server upon materialization and receive messages that are sent to the subscribed topics.

Scala
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/scala/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/scaladsl/MqttSourceSpec.scala) { #create-source }

Java
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/java/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/javadsl/MqttSourceTest.java) { #create-source }

And finally run the source.

Scala
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/scala/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/scaladsl/MqttSourceSpec.scala) { #run-source }

Java
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/java/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/javadsl/MqttSourceTest.java) { #run-source }

This source has a materialized value (@scaladoc[Future](scala.concurrent.Future) in Scala API and @extref[CompletionStage](java-api:java/util/concurrent/CompletionStage) in Java API) which is completed when the subscription to the MQTT broker has been completed.

To publish messages to the MQTT server create a sink and run it.

Scala
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/scala/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/scaladsl/MqttSourceSpec.scala) { #run-sink }

Java
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/java/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/javadsl/MqttSourceTest.java) { #run-sink }

It is also possible to connect to the MQTT server in bidirectional fashion, using a single underlying connection (and client ID). To do that create an MQTT flow that combines the functionalities of an MQTT source and an MQTT sink.

Scala
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/scala/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/scaladsl/MqttFlowSpec.scala) { #create-flow }

Java
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/java/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/javadsl/MqttFlowTest.java) { #create-flow }

Run the flow by connecting a source of messages to be published and a sink for received messages.

Scala
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/scala/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/scaladsl/MqttFlowSpec.scala) { #run-flow }

Java
: @@snip ($alpakka$/mqtt/src/test/java/akka/stream/alpakka/mqtt/javadsl/MqttFlowTest.java) { #run-flow }

### Running the example code

The code in this guide is part of runnable tests of this project. You are welcome to edit the code and run it in sbt.

Scala
:   ```
    sbt
    > mqtt/testOnly *.MqttSourceSpec
    ```

Java
:   ```
    sbt
    > mqtt/testOnly *.MqttSourceTest
    ```
