## Releasing

1. Check [closed issues without a milestone](https://github.com/akka/alpakka/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20no%3Amilestone) and either assign them the 'upcoming' release milestone or 'invalid'
1. Create a [new release](https://github.com/akka/alpakka/releases/new) with:
    * the next tag version (e.g. `v0.3`)
    * title and release description including notable changes
    * link to the [milestone](https://github.com/akka/alpakka/milestones) showing an overview of closed issues for this release
    * overview of contributors generated by `./scripts/authors.scala`
1. Travis CI will start a [CI build](https://travis-ci.org/akka/alpakka/builds) for the new tag and publish artifacts to Bintray.
    * Even if the build failed, artifacts may have been pushed, so verify that (see https://github.com/akka/alpakka/issues/478 for the kinds of spurious failure that may happen)
1. Login to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/akka/maven/alpakka) and sync artifacts to Maven Central:
    * Go to the 'Maven Central' tab and use your sonatype credentials.
    * This can take a long time (you can check https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories for progress)
1. Close the milestone for this release and start a new one

### Releasing only updated docs

It is possible to release a revised documentation to the already existing release.

1. Create a new branch from a release tag. If a revised documentation is for the `v0.3` release, then the name of the new branch should be `docs/v0.3`.
2. Make all of the required changes to the documentation.
3. Add and commit `version.sbt` file that sets the version to the one, that is being revised. For example `version in ThisBuild := "0.3"`.
4. Push the branch. Tech Hub will see the new branch and will build and publish revised documentation.
